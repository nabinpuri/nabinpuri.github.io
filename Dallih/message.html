"   The day I started.... <br>
    Thinking you,
    Never thought you would be reality<br>
    Talking you,
    Never thought your heart could listen<br>
    Seeing you,
    Never thought I would feel you<br>
    Feeling you,
    Never thought I could touch you<br>
    Touching you,
    Never thought I would care you<br>
    Caring you,
    Never thought I would love you<br>
    Loving you
    Never thought I would make you mine<br>
    Make you mine,
    Never thought I would be yours and only yours<br><br>
     ***Happy Valentine Day budi***<br>
     **you are my World**<br>
      *A kiss of Love..*
